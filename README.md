`storybook-theming-addon` is a Storybook add-on which allows you to tweak and export theme files directly in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org). You can use the add-on with any React styling library.

The addon provides a `Theming` panel with fields that you can use to tweak values of the theme files in Storybook. It also provides a decorator to wrap your stories/components, enabling you to see the theme changes in real time. After making all the desired changes to the theme files, the add-on allows you to export it.
